- Note: During this run the vehicle was driven manually by use of steering wheel, gas pedal and brake pedal. We did not expect commands to be sent to the can bus we only expected to recieve data from it.

## Experiment setup in three terminals:
- Installed jupyter notebook
sudo apt-get install jupyter
- Installed matplotlib for python3
sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib

sudo apt-get install python3-gnupg

sudo apt-get install python3-rospkg
Which prompted the uninstall of 174 ros packages.
